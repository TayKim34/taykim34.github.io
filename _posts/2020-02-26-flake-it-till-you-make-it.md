## Project Overview

### The Problem
Customers may find that an arcade machine may not be working properly. To ensure the issue is fixed as soon as possible, the customer needs a way to communicate with an attendant about the issue.

### The Goal
The goal is to create a feature in an arcade website to allow users to submit support tickets.

## Research & Defining the Problem

### Hypothesis
If the user has an easy way to communicate any issues regarding the arcade machines, then there will be a greater chance that the machines will be in working order sooner.

### Personas
To understand the users that would face such a problem, I developed a couple of personas.

A passionate gamer that used arcade time as decompressing time.

A caring mother wants their kids to play in a working and clean environment.

### Journey Mapping

To understand the issues these users may face, I developed a journey map for each.

Austin, the gamer, often found himself getting more and more frustrated after finding his favorite game isn’t working properly. This frustration is amplified when he finds his second choice is incredibly dirty. These issues lead him to try to find an attendant to complain about these issues but are unable to find anyone. He then resolves to just leave.

Mary, on the other hand, isn’t active as the arcade. She drops her children off at the arcade with some money, so she can shop alone in peace. However, upon her return one of the children admits to making a mess on one of the machines. Petrified, she seeks out an attendant to inform them of the mess and to get their child to apologize, but can’t seem to find anyone. She decides to leave with her kids without informing anyone of the mess.

## Exploring the Design

### User Flow
From what I’ve seen from personal experience and my competitive audit, starting the user flow by scanning a QR code to make it easier for users to access the website quickly while in the arcade. This flow generally follows the steps it takes to find, fill out, and submit a form. This allowed me to get a sense of what pages I’d need to include.

### Wireframing
I initially started with the screens necessary for the user to be able to submit a form. After that, I determined what pages would be typically included in an arcade’s website and made a site map from there.

### Prototyping
While this project focused on the support feature of an arcade website, I still needed to design a full website for the feature to be included in. I had the website focus on a small handful of information, which I narrowed down based on my research of competitors.

I included assets from the Figma community to make the forms more interactive for user testing. I also added a Safari browser frame to make the app feel a bit more authentic.

## Refining the Design

### Usability Testing
Before moving on to adding colors and images, I needed users to test the core functionality of my website design. I conducted a remote moderated usability test with 5 different users. My findings were as follows:
* Most users want a quick submission process, so users would prefer a more simple process.
* Users like having options, but not too many, so I should ensure all categories for support forms are necessary and incorporate an “other” option.
* Most users don’t like large text boxes, so the forms should avoid using large text boxes when possible.
* Some users interpret “malfunction” differently than intended, so forms should use more straightforward and clear language.
* Some users struggled with finding/reading some features, so the design should have enough contrast and highly visible coloring.

### Mock Ups
When deciding on colors for this arcade website, I decided to work with an arcade logo. I used the logo to give me a sense of direction for the typography and the color palette. 

Once images were added and the background darkened, it appeared some sections were blending in together. To avoid this, I included dividers in the main color. 

### High Fidelity Prototype
Viewing the prototype helps me see if the ideas worked as intended. The main thing that helped a lot was having the clicked category a different color from the rest of the categories allowed the user to know exactly what page they were on. I used blue as the primary color and pink as the accent color. I decided this because pink is a bit harder on the eyes, so I wanted to minimize the use as much as possible, but kept it because it contrasted well next to the blue.

### Desktop Website
Converting this mobile design to a desktop screen was initially challenging. The core of my initial website design very much favored a mobile screen since that would likely be where most users would be seeing the website.

## Final Thoughts

### What insights have I gained from this project?
I gathered a lot of insight into how forms are made and how to make them more accessible to more users.

### How would I continue this project?
The main way to continue this project would be to conduct more usability testing, as the high-fidelity designs have yet to be tested. It would also be ideal to have a tablet version of the website eventually.
