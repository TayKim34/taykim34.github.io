    <p> My philosophy as a designer is to always consider how users will interact with my design and to be as accessible as possible.
        Design, like many things, is constantly evolving. Products need to be willing to change with the times and seek to be able to reach and be used by as many users as possible.
        I developed this website with the use of a Ruby Jekyll theme, then customized it with the use of my 
        knowledge of Markdown, HTML, and CSS. This site showcases two case studies I have completed with extensive 
        detail regarding the entire process from beginning to end. More information about me can be found at "About Me".</p>
