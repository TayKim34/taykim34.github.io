Hi, I’m Taylor! I have been an artist and working freelance designer for years. I am passionate about art, design, and problem-solving. I often think about how designs are implemented into different everyday items, apps, and media we interact with. It is important to me to ensure that the product I am working with has easy and clean designs so users can seamlessly use it. Being a user-centered UX Designer, I stand behind the principle that products should be intuitive and accessible to everyone wanting to use them.

Creativity is in my veins. Every hobby I have is a way to have a creative outlet. From painting, drawing, and graphic design to video games, reading, and cosplaying. Everything is a way for me to show myself what I can do with what tools I have.

I can’t wait to see the new challenges I can face with upcoming projects. It is exciting to think about applying my skills and learning new skills to problem solve and make sure the user has the best experience they can with any product they want to use.
